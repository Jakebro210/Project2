The concept behind this second project was to familiarize ourselves with what bash, shell, and scripting is within git bash. The first step was to simply type the commands: "date", "cal", "pwd", and "ls". All of these commands worked properly except for "cal" which give me an error stating "bash: cal: command not found". The next step was to practice scripting by creating a new file in vi but our instructions stated that we needed to use nano instead. When I used nano, I noticed it was more user friendy than vi was and listed helpful commands towards the bottom. I typed the same commands in the first part inside of nano and then saved my file within my "Documents" folder. After this, I used chmod +x to make my file executable and then ran it with "./". I noted that the only program that did not run was the "cal" command so I did not see a calendar on my screen. I used nano to go back into the newly created task.sh file and added "#!/bin/bash" which allows the script's interperter to be defined as Bash. The next section in this tutorial we had to use the command file to see the identify of the "hello world" file. It was a shell script, ASCII text executable file. I used the copy command after to send the standard output of the file "hello world" to a new named "0_vyz". A quick check of the command "file" proves that contents were successfully copied from file "hello world". I used nano to go insde the file and delete the line at the header "#!/bin/bash". After saving and quitting, I used file to see the new identity and it was changed to just ASCII text. The next step in the tutorial was to see an alternate way to use execute a script and that was used by simply saying "bash filename". This way is a lot cleaner and there is no need to use a text editor. The last part in the tutorial was learning the difference between an absolute path and a relative path. Knowing the difference between the two is crucial when changing directories and when sending content to other files. Simply put, if you are within the directory of the file which you are executing a command for then you are in a relative path and do no have to explicitly state the path with "/etc..". However, if you are in a seperate directory, you have to state the path explicitly with multiple "/" so that whatever action you peform can be properly executed. A really good command that can be used here is "pwd" or print working directory which tells you which directory you are currently in.
